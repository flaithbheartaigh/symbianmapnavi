# MapNavi on Symbian OS #

## Introduction ##
I recently implemented a small Symbian application which uses Google static map API for navigation. I would like to make it open source and develop it together with those who are interested.I have implemented the browsing feature. Basically user can browse the map by pressing navigation key and also zoom feature is implemented.

## News ##
  * The current version is 0.0.1
  * The current problem that I am encountering is how to use google static API to fetch the nearby places, like pizza or restaurant. I don't know which API I should use to get the array of coordinates

## Feature Project Plan ##
My recent plan is to add the following features to the program:

  1. . GPS postioning
  1. . Allow user to input address and mark it in the map
  1. . Show interested places nearby , like pizza, restaurant.
  1. . "route from" and "route to" feature
  1. . Save favorate location as landmark
  1. . Upload pictures to google map
